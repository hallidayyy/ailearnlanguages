# Podcast Introduction
Hello, this is Real Easy English, the podcast where we have conversations in Easy English to help you learn. I'm Beth and I'm Neil. Remember you can find all the vocabulary for this episode and a text version on our website, BBC learning english.com.

# Greetings and Topic Introduction
How are you today Neil? I'm very well. Thank you Beth. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. What is the topic of our conversation today? Well today Beth, we're talking about schools. We'll talk about our favorite subjects and what qualifications we have.

# Explanation of Qualifications
Okay Neil, first, can you explain the word qualifications? Yes, a qualification is an official record that you have successfully done an exam or training for something. So for example, you can receive a qualification in speaking English if you pass a certain exam.

# Neil's School Experiences
Okay, great. So Neil, what qualifications did you do at school? Well, I took all of the normal exams we do in the UK: GCSE and then A-levels. These are school exams. And then I am the same. I went to school in the UK and did all of the same exams probably that you did. Did you like school? Yes, I did like school. I think I just like being with my friends and I thought most subjects were quite interesting. Yeah.

# Beth's School Experiences
I think I'm the same. What were your favorite subjects Beth? I really liked English, which sounds quite predictable because now English is part of my job. But I also quite like textiles, which was a subject all about how to make clothes, and I made a hat. So it was quite a practical subject and I enjoyed that. Do you still wear the hat? I do not, it was not a good hat. What was your favorite subject? I also liked English, but I think my favorite subject was history.

# Least Favorite Subject
Hi, what about your least favorite subject? That's easy, maths. I hate maths. You still hate maths. I still hate maths. So in this conversation about school, we used words like quite, very, and really. Quite good means a little bit good. Very good and really good mean a lot. So for example, Neil, I quite like history, but you really like history. You liked it a lot at school. Whereas I liked it a bit. So did you not like maths because you went very good at it? Yes, I think I was really bad at maths and I didn't like it because I found it very hard. How about you? I quite liked maths. I don't think there was a subject that I didn't really like.

# Nerd Discussion
So Beth, it sounds like you were good at everything at school and worked hard. So do you think you were a nerd? Well, a nerd is an informed somebody at school, so was I a nerd? Well, I did enjoy school and I worked hard and one time my friend and I asked our teacher why we hadn't been given full marks for presentation. And then she said, oh, I'll just give you full marks. I think that was probably quite a nerdy thing to do. So, maybe that's very nerdy Beth.

# Vocabulary Review
Let's look at the vocabulary we learned during the conversation. We had qualification, a record that you have completed an exam or a course. We had quite, this usually means a little bit, and really are both used to mean a lot. So for example, I'm very good at maths, and nerd, which is an informal word for someone who is good at school like you Beth. Thanks.
