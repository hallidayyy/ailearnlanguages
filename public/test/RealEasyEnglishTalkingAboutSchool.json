But I also quite like textiles which was a subject all about how to make clothes and I made a hat. So it was quite a practical subject and I enjoyed that do you still wear the hat? I do not it was not a good hat. What was your favorite subject? I also liked English, but I think my favorite subject was history."

So in this conversation about school, we used words like quite very and really quite good means a little bit good. Very good and really good mean a lot. So for example Neil, I quite like history, but you really like history. You liked it a lot at school. Whereas I liked it a bit. So did you not like maths because you went very good at it. Yes, I think I was really bad at maths and I didn't like it because I found it very hard. How about you I quite liked liked maths. I don't think there was a subject that I didn't really like so Beth."

Well, I did enjoy school and I worked hard and one time my friend and I asked our teacher why we hadn't been given full marks for presentation. And then she said, oh, I'll just give you full marks. I think that was probably quite a nerdy thing to do. So, maybe that's very nerdy birth. Let's look at the vocabulary. We learned during the conversation. We had qualification a record that you have completed an exam or a course. We had quite this usually means a little Berry and really are both used to mean a lot."
